## Introduction
Real-time hand gesture detection is a powerful technology with various applications such as sign language recognition, interactive interfaces, and gaming. This project leverages TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, and OpenCV, a computer vision library, to build a system that can detect and interpret hand gestures in real-time.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection from video input.
- Utilizes deep learning techniques with TensorFlow for gesture recognition.
- Integration with OpenCV for video capturing and processing.
- Supports various hand gestures and their corresponding actions.
- Adjustable parameters for gesture recognition and detection accuracy.

## Installation
To use the hand gesture detection system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshuch1708/Real-time-Hand-Gesture-Detection-with-TensorFlow-and-OpenCV.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe tensorflow keras
   ```

## Usage
To run the hand gesture detection system, execute the following command:
```
python Real-time Hand Gesture Detection with TensorFlow and OpenCV.py
```
The system will start capturing video from the default camera and detect hand gestures in real-time. You can define actions for different gestures and customize the system's parameters in the configuration file.
